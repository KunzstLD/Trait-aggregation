# Script that compares two trait aggregation methods 
# 1) Species - Genus - Family (using Mode)
# 2) Species - Family
# TODO: 
  # Provide Details on aggregation methods
  # Write functions for aggregation
  # compare accross regions

# Methods used: 
  # Aggregation over genus and family (using median and mode)
  # Aggregation directly to family level
  # (Aggregation using Power Average Operator?)

# Test for: 
 # fuzzy coded data
 # binary coded data
 # binary data transformed to fuzzy coded (on genus level, by nr. of species)
