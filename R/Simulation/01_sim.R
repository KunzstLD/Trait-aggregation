# Simulation Idea Ben:
# I wonder if some simulation could be useful to determine in what
# circumstances the different aggregation methods will produce similar
# or different results. E.g. If all families were to have the same number of
# genus and all genus the same number of species (something which would
#  never happen),
# then it will not matter (much) whether direct, stepwise or
# weighted aggregation is used.
# It only becomes important if direct, stepwise or weighted is used,
# as the number of genus per family and/or species per genus differ.
# Some simulation that varies the taxonomic hierarchy and variability in traits
# between genus within a family and species within genus, â€¦.,
# could be useful to show, under what circumstances the choice of
# aggregation method becomes important.
# Then can look back to the databases and see if
# these circumstances come up much.
# If these circumstances are rare,
# then do not need to consider the aggregation methods.

# simulate different levels of taxonomic hierarchy:
# from species - genus - family
# which traits? traits variability should also vary
# Additional factor: taxonomic resolution

# Fix: Macropelopiini 1 in NZ Data

# 100 runs + 5 sds -> 500
# 500*25 = 12500 rows!
