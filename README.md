## Content overview

### - /Data

To family level aggregated trait datasets (see R scripts ...*_agg* in https://github.com/KunzstLD/Invertebrate_traits) and data for the re-analysis of the salinity study of *Szöcs et al. 2014*, as well as for the comparison of assigned and aggregated traits.

### - R/

R scripts. To reproduce the analysis follow along the script *Run.R.*

## Research questions

- What's the effect of aggregating species traits to higher taxonomical orders?
- Does aggregation and harmonisation decrease our ability to detect trait-environment relationships?
